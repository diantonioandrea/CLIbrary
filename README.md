	...

	class movement:
		def __init__(self, otherCodes: list):
			...

			self.reason = CLIbrary.strIn({"request": "Movement reason", "allowedChars": ["-", "'", ".", ",", ":"]})
			self.amount = CLIbrary.numIn({"request": "Movement amount"})
			self.date = CLIbrary.dateIn({"request": "Movement date"})

			...

			self.confirmation = CLIbrary.boolIn({"request": "Verify \"" + str(self) + "\""})
```

	fileHandler["data"] = user
	CLIbrary.aDump(fileHandler)
```
